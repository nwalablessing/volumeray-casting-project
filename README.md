## THIS PROJECT AIMS TO DEVELOP A POWEFUL REAL-TIME VOLUME RENDERING ENGINE


THIS PROJECCT USES JAVASCRIPT 

I also used VISUAL STUDIO CODE IDE TO RUN MY PROJECT
 I CREATED A FOLDER ON MY DESKTOP CALLED PROJECT AND RIGHT CLICK IN THE FOLDER AND SELECTED OPEN WITH CODE
 I THEN OPENED A NEW TERMINAL ON MY VISUAL STUDIO CODE IDE
 THEN I TYPED IN git clone command  and my repository URL to clone it
 i also used the git init coomand
 
 once it was succesful i could see my folder i created on the top left corner in my visual studio IDE
 
 i dropped down the folders and went to the index.html code
