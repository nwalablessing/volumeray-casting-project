# FULL EXPLANATION ON HOW I RAN A CODE ON VOLUME RAY CASTING

FIRST I CREATED AND REGISTRED A GITHUB ACCOUNT

THEN I CREATED A NEW REPOSITORY ON MY GITHUB AND I GAVE IT A NAME CALLED Volume-ray-casting-project.

i then searched for an existing project on github on volune ray casting https://github.com/Chan-Mao-Hsiang/VolumeRayCasting-master
to get my source code.



i used SSH to coonect and authenticate remote server and services

THIS PROJECT AIMS TO DEVELOP A POWERFUL REAL-TIME VOLUME RENDERING ENGINE


THIS PROJECCT USES JAVASCRIPT 

I also used VISUAL STUDIO CODE IDE TO RUN MY PROJECT

 I CREATED A FOLDER ON MY DESKTOP CALLED PROJECT AND RIGHT CLICK IN THE FOLDER AND SELECTED OPEN WITH CODE
 
 I THEN OPENED A NEW TERMINAL ON MY VISUAL STUDIO CODE IDE
 
 Then i typed in the  "git clone" command  and my repository URL to clone it
 
 i also used the git init coomand
 
 once it was succesful, i could see my folder i created on the top left corner in my visual studio IDE
 
 i dropped down the folders and went to the index.html code
 
 below is a picture of the index.html code
 
 
 
 ![my html code](https://github.com/nwalablessing/volumeray-casting-project/assets/106828675/a7d4826b-32ef-4656-964f-07d65dfc9a21)


to run the javascript index.html code i right clicked on index.html as seen from the picture above and selected reveal in file explorer.

it then took me to my folder on my desktop

picture as shown below

I was able to view the output by clicking on INDEX using microsoft edge i was able to view the output of my code

picture of the output is shown below

i then used the git push command using my repository url to push my project to my git hub account.

when push was successful i then was able to see it in my git hub repository i created.

please note: i also had to confirm and approve authentication with my mobile phone.

![git push command 1](https://github.com/nwalablessing/volumeray-casting-project/assets/106828675/e7e02aa0-f059-4d43-b209-7595fc496479)



![complete gitpush authentication](https://github.com/nwalablessing/volumeray-casting-project/assets/106828675/634b181e-f3c8-4ca3-b6c3-6e6ff58ab083)

I then edited my Readme and also commited it.

PLEASE KINDLY NOTE THAT THIS PROJECT IS A SUCCESSOR OF EARLIER EXPERIMENTS WITH VOLUME RENDERING BY DRAWING POINT CLOUDS: GitHub https://github.com/Chan-Mao-Hsiang/VolumeRayCasting-master

This experiment is not suitable for clinical use.

### THE END
